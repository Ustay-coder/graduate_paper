[PI] are prompt-inspired text, and are standalone responses to prompts that are at least three days old.

[PI] posts must have a link to the prompt that inspired the story, and contain the story within the text area of the post itself, not as an independent comment

A [PI] must be inspired by a prompt from either r/WritingPrompts or r/shortstories.

A [PI] story must go in one post, or in a post and the comments below it if it is too long to fit in one post. It cannot be serialized and split into several posts. If you want to share a story in several parts, check out r/shortstories.

Responses should be written by you. This is for sharing your own stories, not someone else's.

Please don't post [PI] more than once a day

Note: Rules 1 (no plagiarism and no AI) and 2 (No content harmful to the community) still apply to [PI]s.

Note 2: You can use [PI] to respond to deleted or removed prompts, although you still must include a link to the prompt.
