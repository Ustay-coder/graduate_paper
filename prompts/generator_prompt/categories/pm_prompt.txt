[PM] prompts are an inverse [WP], in wherein your responses prompt you to write something, rather than the other way around.

In a [PM] Prompt, you respond to comments as if they were prompts (they must follow all the rules of prompt responses), and thus help you expand your creative output and writing skills.

Before posting one:

You must have responded to prompts before posting your [PM], meaning you've written a top-level story or poem as a reply to a prompt.
You must respond to your prompts within six hours or it will be removed. Clogging the sub with neglected [PM] prompts is a very bad thing!
Example: [PM] Prompt me sci-fi and action, please. I want to practice writing!
