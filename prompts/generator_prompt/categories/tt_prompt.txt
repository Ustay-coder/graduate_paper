[TT] prompts are our weekly focus on certain styles of writing (War Stories, Hardboiled Detectives, High Fantasy) and must conform to whatever that week's theme is (see the sidebar for the current Theme)

We reset it each Thursday and will sticky those prompts randomly during the day, but are encouraging them all week

Normal prompts are still allowed on Thursdays, it's just that we take that day to focus on them

Please do not post TTs with previous week's themes. They will be removed and you will be asked to repost as a general [WP].
